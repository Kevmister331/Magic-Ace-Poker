# Poker Chip Ecosystem
## Kevin Hu - CPSC 210 Term Project

I will be creating a **virtual poker chip counter** that
stimulates how poker chips are used in a real poker ecosystem.
This includes players having a starting chip balance,
adding their chips into the pot, raising, checking, etc.
When a person wins their hand, all of the chips in the pot get
transferred into the winners chip balance. To clarify - I am
simply designing the chip economy itself, and there will be no
playing cards or poker game mechanics involved (such as
distributing cards, or analyzing winning hands).

This application will be used by people who want to play poker
in real life with their friends, but have no poker chips!
Playing cards are very accessible and cheap, but chips are not.
Poker chips are heavy to bring around (so you are only limited
to playing at home), and expensive to buy.

This idea was inspired from when I travelled to The Philippines
with my friends, and we had a long layover at the airport with
nothing but playing cards. We wanted to play poker but did not
have any chips to simulate the betting system (the fun part of poker).
